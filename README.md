# Dotfiles

Most of my personal dotfiles can be found in this branch. I use dfm (dot files manager) to install and managed the dotfiles. See [ justone/dotfiles ](https://github.com/justone/dotfiles) for details on how to use it.

Passwords and other secretes are censored. To find these and substitue them for the realthing, do

```bash
$ grep -nri GIT-CENSORED .
```
